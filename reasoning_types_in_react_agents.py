Implementing reasoning types in code typically involves designing algorithms or logic that allow AI models or agents to make decisions based on specific reasoning methods. Here's how you can implement some common types of reasoning in code:

### 1. **Deductive Reasoning**
   Deductive reasoning can be implemented using rules and logical inference. For example, a **propositional logic** system can be used to infer conclusions based on given facts.

   **Code Example**: Deductive Reasoning with Python (`sympy.logic`)

   ```python
   from sympy.logic.boolalg import And, Or
   from sympy.abc import A, B

   # Define premises
   premise1 = Or(A, B)  # A or B is true
   premise2 = A  # A is true

   # Deduce conclusion
   conclusion = And(premise1, premise2)
   print(conclusion.simplify())  # Simplifies to B (B is true)
   ```

   **Explanation**: Given the premises "A or B" and "A", we can deduce that "B" must be true.

### 2. **Inductive Reasoning**
   Inductive reasoning typically involves statistical methods to generalize conclusions from specific data points. This is common in machine learning, where a model generalizes from training data to unseen data.

   **Code Example**: Inductive Reasoning with Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

   # Load dataset
   iris = load_iris()
   X = iris.data
   y = iris.target

   # Split data into training and test sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

   # Train the model (inductive reasoning)
   model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Make a prediction
   prediction = model.predict(X_test)
   print(prediction)
   ```

   **Explanation**: This example uses logistic regression to learn patterns from training data (inductive reasoning) and generalizes to predict new outcomes.

### 3. **Abductive Reasoning**
   Abductive reasoning is used to infer the best possible explanation for a given observation. This can be implemented by considering a set of possible hypotheses and selecting the most probable one based on available evidence.

   **Code Example**: Abductive Reasoning with Bayesian Inference

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from scipy.stats import norm

   # Observed data
   observed = 5.0  # Observed outcome

   # Hypotheses: We will consider two possible causes (hypotheses)
   hypothesis_1_mean = 4.0  # Mean of hypothesis 1 (e.g., event A)
   hypothesis_2_mean = 6.0  # Mean of hypothesis 2 (e.g., event B)

   # Likelihoods based on the normal distribution (modeling noise/error)
   likelihood_1 = norm.pdf(observed, hypothesis_1_mean, 1)
   likelihood_2 = norm.pdf(observed, hypothesis_2_mean, 1)

   # Prior probabilities (assumed)
   prior_1 = 0.5
   prior_2 = 0.5

   # Posterior probabilities using Bayes' Theorem
   posterior_1 = likelihood_1 * prior_1
   posterior_2 = likelihood_2 * prior_2

   # Normalize the posterior probabilities
   total = posterior_1 + posterior_2
   posterior_1 /= total
   posterior_2 /= total

   print(f"Posterior probability for hypothesis 1: {posterior_1}")
   print(f"Posterior probability for hypothesis 2: {posterior_2}")
   ```

   **Explanation**: This code applies **Bayesian Inference** to calculate the likelihood of two hypotheses given the observed evidence, and selects the most probable hypothesis (abductive reasoning).

### 4. **Analogical Reasoning**
   Analogical reasoning involves drawing comparisons between similar cases or situations. This can be implemented by comparing features or using similarity metrics.

   **Code Example**: Analogical Reasoning using Cosine Similarity

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
   import numpy as np

   # Define two cases (represented as vectors)
   case_1 = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0])  # Case 1 (vectorized)
   case_2 = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])  # Case 2 (vectorized)

   # Compute cosine similarity between cases (measuring how similar they are)
   similarity = cosine_similarity([case_1], [case_2])
   print(f"Similarity between case 1 and case 2: {similarity[0][0]}")
   ```

   **Explanation**: This code computes the cosine similarity between two cases (represented as vectors) to measure their similarity, which is a form of analogical reasoning.

---

### 5. **Causal Reasoning**
   Causal reasoning involves establishing cause-and-effect relationships. You can use **causal models** like **causal graphs** or apply machine learning methods to infer causality.

   **Code Example**: Causal Reasoning with `DoWhy` Library

   ```python
   import dowhy
   from dowhy import CausalModel
   import pandas as pd

   # Create a simple dataset
   data = pd.DataFrame({
       'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       'Y': [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
   })

   # Define the causal graph
   model = CausalModel(
       data=data,
       treatment='X',
       outcome='Y',
       graph="digraph {X -> Y}"
   )

   # Estimate causal effect
   identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()
   causal_effect = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand)
   print(f"Causal Effect: {causal_effect}")
   ```

   **Explanation**: This example uses the `DoWhy` library to identify and estimate causal effects between variables, which is a key aspect of causal reasoning.

### 6. **Probabilistic Reasoning**
   Probabilistic reasoning involves making decisions or predictions based on probabilities. This can be implemented using **Bayesian networks** or probabilistic models.

   **Code Example**: Probabilistic Reasoning with `pomegranate` Library (Naive Bayes)

   ```python
   from pomegranate import NaiveBayes
   import numpy as np

   # Define dataset (features: X, labels: Y)
   X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 2]])
   y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])

   # Create and train Naive Bayes model
   model = NaiveBayes()
   model.fit(X, y)

   # Predict for new data
   prediction = model.predict([[2, 2]])
   print(f"Predicted class: {prediction[0]}")
   ```

   **Explanation**: This code uses a **Naive Bayes classifier**, which is a probabilistic model, to predict the class of new data based on learned probabilities.

---

### 7. **Common-Sense Reasoning**
   Common-sense reasoning can be modeled using knowledge graphs or by using pre-trained models in natural language processing (NLP).

   **Code Example**: Using Pre-trained NLP Models for Common-Sense Reasoning (HuggingFace Transformers)

   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline

   # Load a common-sense reasoning model
   model = pipeline("text-generation", model="facebook/bart-large")

   # Input sentence with some ambiguity
   prompt = "If it is raining, people usually carry umbrellas. John went outside, what should he have with him?"

   # Generate response (common-sense reasoning)
   response = model(prompt)
   print(response[0]['generated_text'])
   ```

   **Explanation**: This example uses a pre-trained model from HuggingFace to generate common-sense responses based on a given prompt.

---

### 8. **Moral and Ethical Reasoning**
   Ethical reasoning often involves rule-based systems or custom models that adhere to a set of ethical principles.

   **Code Example**: Moral Decision-making Based on Predefined Rules

   ```python
   def ethical_reasoning(action):
       if action == "steal":
           return "Unethical: It violates the property rights of others."
       elif action == "help":
           return "Ethical: It helps others."
       else:
           return "Neutral: No clear ethical guideline."

   # Example ethical decision
   action = "steal"
   decision = ethical_reasoning(action)
   print(decision)
   ```

   **Explanation**: This is a basic implementation of moral reasoning based on predefined rules. More complex systems can involve deeper learning models for ethics.

### Conclusion
Each type of reasoning can be implemented in a variety of ways, depending on the complexity and the specific problem you're trying to solve. From simple rule-based systems to complex probabilistic models, AI reasoning can span a wide spectrum.
